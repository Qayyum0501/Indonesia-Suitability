# Solar Suitability Analysis

Hi, this repository contains R scripts for analyzing solar and wind energy placement, specifically focused on a case study of Indonesia.

The analysis begins with the solar-data-extraction.R script, which processes the raw data available in the corresponding folder. Following this, the suitability analysis is conducted using the suitability-solar.R script. Finally, the financial aspects are evaluated with the financial-analysis.R script
